# 6.0 Blocks

This module has only one Block - where you can show selection of available languages. 

To set it up, go to the Blocks:

The Block windows opens:

and when you click on the "Edit" button, it will open the Block Configuration windows:

Here the key option is to decide if you want to show the flags to the user, or text, and if images, then how many in the row. 

Save it and you're done.
